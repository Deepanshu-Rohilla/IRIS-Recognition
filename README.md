# Biometric Sytem for Iris Recognition

Abstract: This project intends to identify humans by they iris using techniques of image processing. Given an image of eyes, return a validation of those eyes.

Requirements:

```
matplotlib=3.5.3=pypi_0
matplotlib-inline=0.1.6=pypi_0

scikit-image=0.22.0=pypi_0
scikit-learn=1.4.2=pypi_0
scipy=1.9.1=pypi_0
```

Install the dependencies with

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

 It's necessary to have opencv installed (or in a virtual enviroment)

To run the code with norm as the distance, use the following command:
